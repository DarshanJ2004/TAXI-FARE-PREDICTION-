# TAXI-FARE-PREDICTION-
**Objective**: The objective of this project is to develop a system that can predict the fare of a taxi ride based on factors such as distance, time of day, and location.

**Description**: The project involves the following key steps:

**Data Collection**: Collect a dataset containing information about taxi rides, including features such as pickup and drop-off locations, pickup time, distance traveled, and fare amount.

**Data Cleaning and Exploration**: Clean the dataset by removing any outliers or missing values. Explore the dataset to understand the distribution of features and identify any patterns or correlations.

**Feature Engineering**: Create new features or transform existing features to improve the performance of the machine learning model. For example, you could create new features such as the day of the week or the time of day.

**Model Selection**: Select a machine learning model (e.g., linear regression, decision tree, random forest) to use for fare prediction. Train the model using a subset of the dataset and evaluate its performance using cross-validation.

**Model Training**: Train the selected model using the entire dataset. Tune the hyperparameters of the model to improve its performance.

**Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained model using a separate test dataset to assess its performance in predicting taxi fares accurately.

**Deployment**: Deploy the trained model in a real-time application where it can predict taxi fares based on input parameters such as pickup and drop-off locations and time of day.

**Technologies Used**: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib (for visualization).
